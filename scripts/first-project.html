            <p>I really like to crochet<br /> It's like knitting but instead of 2 big needles, you have 1 big hook thingy.</p>
            <h3>It's cool because crochet and programming are similar in a way, let me explain why.</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>They are similar in the sense that you have your code/patteren, and you wouldn't be able to create your website/crochet porject without that code/ pattern</p>
